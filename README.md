# aligment_of_sequences_on_reference
At the end of the project, student will have implemented several libraries which will enable alignment of a large amount of substrings (of various sizes) to a much larger string from which they originate. The objective is to join these libraries into a single program, often called mapper, in order to map long erroneous fragments from third generation of sequencing technologies to a reference genome, which has various use cases in bioinformatics.
